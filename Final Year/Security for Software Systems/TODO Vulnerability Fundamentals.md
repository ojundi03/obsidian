# Some Common Terminology
- **Vuln** - A specific flaw or oversight that allows attackers to do something malicious
- **Bug** - An error, mistake, or oversight that results in unexpected and usually undesirable behavious
- **Exploit** - an attack on a vuln.


## Vulnerability Definition
- Vulnerabilities are software mistakes in specification and design, and mostly mistakes in programming
- Any large software package will have thousands of mistakes
- Once discovered, they are potentially used to attack systems
- This is why security patching is done: to eliminate known vulns
- But, many systems never get patched, so the internet is filled with known, exploitable vulernabilities.
## Vulnerability Detection Methods
- Fuzzing
- Application Penetration Testing
- Reverse Engineering
- Source Code Review
- More advanced:
	- Tracking software bugs that might get patched in the future
	- Reversing security patches
		- some of the patches themselves might be vulnerable, or not applied to all systems

## Who wants to find a Vuln?
- Researchers
- Hackers
- Software Companies
- Criminals
- Governments
- Media

## Monetising a 0-Day
### Some costs of a 0-day vuln
- Adobe Reader: $5000 to $30000
- Mac OSX: $20000 - $50000
- Android: $30000 - $60000
- Windows: $60000 - $120000
- IOS: $100000 - $250000

- White Market - Won't get paid much, Legal and ethical
- Black Market - use a broker, get paid big bucks
