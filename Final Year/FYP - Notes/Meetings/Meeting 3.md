- start paper
- amazon firecracker, QEMU
- look for references
- reverse engineering of 3ds, switch, security side of things

- Open source emulators: https://github.com/alnacle/awesome-emulators
- instruction set is a hash table, look up instruction set and do op accordingly


- look into using Godot -> SDL, might same time
- 

- FIgure out the architecture, what supposed to do
- NESdev, open source code reading

- Decide operational way
- Potentially from first principles

- Does it use 


- chap 2: background reading other emus, so on
- chap 3: architecture of the NES, registers, instruction set, base level
	- recognise IO and sound at least
	- Careful of time
	- emulation of screen, input, might be toughest
- Chap 4: implementation
